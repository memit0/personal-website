summary: 'Some thoughts on why I'm going to start writing'
---

I wanted to use this website as a commonplace to organize my thoughts and share my ideas. I sometimes lose focus on my vision and get caught up in mimetic goals and desires. I think this website will be a good reminder for me not to lose focus. Also, I want to share my ideas in order to connect with people and expand my perspective. I struggle to share a lot of my ideas and thoughts in conversation even with some of my closest friends. I will try to keep this website as unorganized and raw as possible, so if any content is contradicting each other or the writing is bad, that's just how I thought and how I wrote during that time. I think it'll also be a good way to gauge how my perspective has changed. I want to use this website to be a place for me to dump my brain.

I don't think anyone will read these, and my preference would be that no one does. However, if you're reading this and find any of my thoughts or projects interesting, please feel free to reach out to meâ€”whether you already know me or are a complete stranger. I would love to chat!
