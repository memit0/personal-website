## why I think purpose is important!

Before sharing my thoughts on purpose, I want to emphasize why I believe it's crucial. I firmly believe that purpose is essential for survival in today's modern world. Historically, daily survival was so demanding that pondering purpose wasn't a luxury people could afford. However, as society has become increasingly convenient, humans now have more free time to contemplate existential questions.
Ironically, the pursuit of purpose can be daunting, leading many to escape through other means, such as substance abuse, religious extremism, obsessive commitment to a club or organization, or throwing themselves into work to stay busy. This evasion can distract from the search for genuine purpose.

## how to find purpose

I don't believe there is a certain point where you can say that you have found your purpose. I think it's a question that should be constantly asked to yourself and updated consistently, however it's a very challenging and frustrating question to think about which brings me to my initial point.

#### start thinking

This may not be entirely accurate, but I believe people's addictions to music, podcasts, drugs, alcohol, and social media stem from **escapism**. The more mental noise you have, the less space you leave for your mind to think independently.
To truly reflect and explore your curiosities, you should get rid of all the external noise. I'm not presenting myself as having all the answers. In fact, I'm still figuring things out. I'm not a monk who shuns music; I struggle with freeing my mind, too.
Allowing yourself to think deeply isn't easy â€“ it's daunting and challenging, but the first step is realizing your addiction to **external noise**.

#### stop running away!

Assuming you've quieted your mind and eliminated external distractions, the next step is to follow your thoughts.
Unfortunately, that's where my understanding currently ends.

The primary purpose of this essay is to document my journey, logging my discoveries and updates as I continue to explore. Hopefully, my reflections thus far can inspire you to begin your own search for purpose.
For now, I'll share some resources that have resonated with me during my journey, and leave you to embark on your own path.
